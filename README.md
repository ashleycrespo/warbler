## Branding
I wanted to make this type specimen to look like it was out of a romance book because that's what the Warbler font by David Jonathan Ross, reminds me of. I tried to achieve this by surrounding "Warbler" and the sides of the page with vines.
## What I Learned
Coding is so time consuming and even for a one page website it took a while to get where I wanted it to be. The hardest part was making everything centered but I was able to overcome that struggle. Thankfully this project wasn't as difficult as my first website.
