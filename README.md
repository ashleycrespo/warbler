## Branding
I wanted to make this type specimen to look and like it was out of a romance book because that's what the Warbler font by David Jonathan Ross. 
## What I Learned
I learned so much and it was my first time coding so I had no idea what anything meant at first but I was thankfully able to understand it fast. Coding is so time consuming and even for a one page website it took a while to get where I wanted it to be. The hardest part was making everything centered but I was able to overcome that struggle.
## Animation
The animation on my website is my favorite part and surprisingly the easiest part. I thought it was going to be just as hard as it would be on after effects but it was just plugging in numbers for the speed and position of what you want to animate.
